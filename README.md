# goldbachs-other-conjecture 
Find the smallest number that fails Goldbach's *other* conjecture.

### Goldbach's *Other* Conjecture
To paraphrase:
> Every odd composite number can be written as the sum of a prime and twice a square.

Thus the evaluation of the first six odd composite numbers is as follows:  
* 9 = 7 + 2×1<sup>2</sup>  
* 15 = 7 + 2×2<sup>2</sup>  
* 21 = 3 + 2×3<sup>2</sup>  
* 25 = 7 + 2×3<sup>2</sup>  
* 27 = 19 + 2×2<sup>2</sup>  
* 33 = 31 + 2×1<sup>2</sup>  

What is the smallest number that fails Goldbachs's *Other* Conjecture?  
That is, what is the smallest odd composite number that **cannot** be written as the sum of a prime and twice a square?

### Motivation
This project was completed for [Project Euler - Problem 46](https://projecteuler.net/problem=46).

I recommend that this code should only be viewed _after_ you've completed your own implementation.  
If you're super stuck, take a break, take a walk, and it will come to you; good luck.
